# OpenWrt scripts
Various OpenWrt scripts for my Nexx WT3020 router with Huawei E3131 3g modem.
Scripts are modification of already existing scripts found on the Internet:
1. signal.sh for showing WiFi stations signal strengths ([source](https://forum.archive.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27581))
2. pingtest.sh for resetting router or 3g modem in case of communication breakdown ([source](duckduckgo.com) & me)
